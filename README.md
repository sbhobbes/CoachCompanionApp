Python/SQLIte Coach's Scheduling App

The purpose of this repository is to house the code for an app that I started working on at the request of my wife when she was thrust into the position of coaching my 4-year-old son's tee-ball team.  When I started working on it I had virtually no knowledge of Python or Kotlin.  I have some formal and hobbyist knowledge of most of the other big OOP languages (i.e. Java, C++, .NET, JavaScript, etc.).  I also have both formal and hobbyist knowledge of SQL, and I understood that SQLite was probably the quickest and easiest way for me to get up and running with some usable code.  

I did some research and determined that the Python API for SQLite was one of the simpler ones to use, so I started there.  My goal was to get a working prototype of the application using Python and SQLite and then eventually morph it into a mobile app using Android Studio, as I only had a week to work on the project before the season started.

What you'll find in this repository is the code as it stands today, which is what we used through the season to schedule each inning.  It needs some updates to the algorithm and I've also learned quite a bit about Pandas and Data Frames since I started the project, so my next task will be to improve efficiency and improve the accuracy of the scheduling algorithm. 

Finally I intend to move into other youth sports and eventually have a full coach companion suite with customizable tables and optional content such as snack schedules and contact lists.
